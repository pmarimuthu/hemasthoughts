 ## :rocket: How to Succeed with Digital Marketing?

This article is about my understanding of *Marketing* and **Digital Marketing** as part of the internship in digital marketing. I am doing this internship in [Digital Deepak](https://digitaldeepak.com/) under the guidance of [Mr. Deepak Kanakaraju](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepakkanakaraju/).
[How to Succeed with Digital Marketing?](https://medium.com/@hema.thiruchelvam07/how-to-succeed-with-digital-marketing-75f0b2fddc78/)

### First let me explain, What is Marketing?

Marketing is how we promote sales or to bring awareness of a product or service to customers through advertising or market research. 
For Example, if a company **X** is bringing in a new product called **Y**, company X will use television advertisements, billboards on the side of the road or the magazine advertisement to make the public aware of the launch of the product Y.

The Basic law of Marketing is to **understand the customer and customer’s needs** that leads to creating a product that fits the customer needs. 
Marketing is a *lifelong process*. *It doesn’t end with sales*. 
You have to constantly interact with your existing customers and build a *relationship of trust* with them. Basically marketing is about sending the right message, to the right person and at the right time.

### What is Digital Marketing?

Digital marketing is marketing using an electronic device or the internet. <br />
We use digital channels such as search engines, social media, email, and other websites to perform marketing with customers. <br />
The number of people who use the internet is increasing day by day. As we have seen earlier, Marketing has always been about connecting with your audience in the right place and at the right time. Today, that means you need to meet them where they are already spending time: on the internet.

### Why to learn Digital Marketing
Digital Marketing has a lot of opportunities, not only in terms of job but also one can earn as a freelance digital marketer. The job opportunities in digital marketing is expected to reach **1,50,000** by the end of 2020.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/590/1*yOSFVeWJLXsGsCIAMtD5OA.png)

Learning Digital Marketing will help you to drive more **traffic** for your business through YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn etc. These applications will help you to reach the customers easily and help in advertising about your product. *As the marketing cannot be outsourced completely to a marketing agency, the founder should be a marketer*. So that the founder himself strategizes his thoughts and can be successful in his/her business.

### Importance of Communication in Marketing

Good marketing is all about good *communication*. Here my mentor gave a completely different perspective on communication that is very true, **Good communication does not be in sophisticated English, don't confuse communication skill with language skills**. The only thing we need to focus on is **Am I able to transfer my thoughts to you effectively**. A good communicator can be a good marketer.

### How to improve your communication
* 1. Write like you talk
* 2. Write more (a minimum 500–1000 words per day.)
* 3. Read more books, magazines, blogs
* 4. Watch English sitcoms and shows
* 5. Think in English

### CATT Marketing Funnel and Framework
**Wealth = n^CATT**
Where **^** denotes power.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*7CaX8egsRHh_x7_mAGjoRQ.png)

**Wealth = n^CATT** <br/>
**n** stands for Niche. It is very important to select a Niche wisely as success and wealth depends on the niche you choose. <br/>
**C** stands for Content. You need to create useful content, blogs, emails, videos, podcasts, webinars, posts, and much more to generate leads. **A** stands for Attention. It drives traffic to your content using SEO, social media, paid ads and referrals. <br/>
**T** stands for Trust. Build trust with your audience. Deep Marketing is connecting with your customers on a deeper level. <br/>
**T** stands for Transaction. This converts your leads into customers and to sales. <br/>

### Niche Selection

You need to find your niche first, the best way to find your niche is to know three things.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*TKIiqlKVJhG8MGqux-X5CA.png)

* Do you have a talent?
* Are you passionate about that talent?
* Is there a market for the talent that you have?

So if you have a talent, you are passionate about the skills and there is a market for the talent, then you can select that *talent as your niche* and you can work on it to develop further. <br />
For Example, If you have a talent and are passionate about painting but if there is no market for it, then nobody will buy the product. Likewise if you have a talent for weaving and there is a market also for that but if you are not passionate about it, you will not be interested to do that.

### Integrated Digital Marketing

Integrated Digital marketing is integration of multiple marketing strategies. <br />

### Types of Digital marketing strategies are
* web development and design
* search engine optimization (SEO) and search engine marketing (SEM)
* content marketing
* social media marketing
* local listings management
* paid advertising (or pay-per-click advertising) campaigns

Content in the center, drive attention through paid advertising, build trust through email marketing, SEO and Social media and do transactions through sales & conversion.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*XIkp4s-5YuNfGx3lMxZUhQ.png)

The idea behind integrated digital marketing is that, while each individual strategy doesn’t have a huge impact on its own, when used in combinations, you can create a more influential online presence.

### Personal Brand

To build your Personal Brand it’s important to *Market yourself*.
You become the Brand Ambassador for the Brand you run.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*eqnH2bhNbsuGLSp9.jpeg)

Building a personal brand is as good as building your personal reputation. <br />
You start small by what so ever means and eventually grow it till everyone knows about the brand name. You earn reputation at each level.
A personal brand cannot be invested in and cannot be sold.
There are many examples for personal brands like Elon Musk, Digital Deepak.

### How to evolve a personal brand
**Learn >> Work >> Blog >> Consult >> Startup >>>>**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*RkAqEiQirONce4e-vgiCrw.png)

* 1. Learn
Learn a new skill through concepts, facts and procedures. Understanding the concepts, remembering the facts and practicing the procedure will help your personal brand to build.
* 2. Work
Work on your new found skill. Practice and implement in the real world will give you better understanding.
* 3. Blog
Write about what you have learned and experienced through your work. You will understand it better when you will write. It will also help in building your brand.
* 4. Consult
As you have a personal brand now through your blog, you have work experience and have learned the fundamentals, you can start consulting other businesses.
* 5. Mentor
Mentor others who want to become like you. Through mentoring you will also learn many things and scale your understanding to a new level.
* 6. Startup
With all the learnings through working, blogging, consulting and mentoring you can startup your own product or service business. All you learnings will help you to develop a personal brand.

Finally, as our mentor says **"Choose a category and become a leader in that category with your personal brand. People will always remember only the No 1. Be the No 1 in whatever category you choose or be No 1 in the sub category.”**

With the learnings of marketing, understanding and implementing the concepts of Digital marketing and with success mindset you can reach heights in Digital marketing.

*Wish you all the very best*;

## :pushpin: Starting a Healthy Lifestyle

Are you ready to start a healthy lifestyle? and do not know where to start and how to proceed? Then you are at the right place and continue to read my blog.

### First, let me start by explaining what is a healthy lifestyle.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity," which implies that this concept goes beyond the existence or lack of existence illnesses.

Consequently, more than just healthy living, we must talk about a healthy lifestyle that includes food, physical exercise, preventive healthcare, work, the relationship with the environment, and social activity.

### A healthy lifestyle gives you a longer and happier life.

With the increasing prevalence of lifestyle diseases in India, one out of four Indians is at risk of dying from non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular ailments, or cancer before the age of seventy.
Adopting bad habits, such as poor diet, lack of exercise, irregular sleep patterns, and resorting to excessive smoking or alcohol use might put you in with 38 million people, who are limited due to one or more chronic health conditions.
Actually, the fact is we all know the importance of following a healthy lifestyle, but the problem most of us have is we do not know where to 
start.

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YUjkW9JaD90" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Components of a healthy lifestyle

The main components that need to be followed for a healthy lifestyle are,
1. Balanced Diet
2. Adequate Exercise
3. Quality Sleep
4. Emotional Health

Before getting into each component and to know about its importance, we need to regularize our timings for our day to day activities and allocate time for our health. In this blog, we are mainly going to focus on how to regularize our timings for our activities and allocate time for our health.

1. Set up a waking time for you.
2. Don't check your phone upon waking up.
3. Do exercise, pranayama, and meditation
4. Have your dinner at least 2 hours before going to bed.
5. Stop using electronic devices 30 minutes before bed
6. Set a bedtime.

Now let us see each step in detail

### Set up a waking time

Set up a waking time which suits you sometime between 5 to 7. If it is preferably matching with sunrise it is pretty much good. Make sure you are waking up daily at the same time. When we wake up and go to sleep at the same time each day, the quality of our sleep can improve, and help us to feel inspired, invigorated, and alert throughout the day.

### Don't check your phone upon waking up

Don't check your phone upon waking up. It is preferred you switch off your data or Wi-Fi connection when you go to bed. When you wake up and immediately check your phone, you're being bombarded with new messages, emails, to-dos, and other stimuli that often create a feeling of stress and anxiety. So, if you want to avoid starting your day feeling rushed, stressed, and anxious, stop checking your smartphone right after waking up.

###  Do exercise, pranayama, and meditation

Allocate time for your exercise routine, be it walking, gym, or yoga. Practice pranayama daily. Meditate at least 10 minutes daily. After you finish your morning routine then you can watch your phone.

### Have your dinner at least 2 hours before going to bed

Have your dinner at least 2 hours before going to bed allowing the stomach to properly digest and focus on preparing for sleep. The foods you consume can disrupt your sleep patterns and also can cause the body's metabolism to slow.

### Stop using electronic devices 30 minutes before bed

Usage of electronic devices before bed can interfere with your sleep. Blue light disrupts the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates the body's sleep cycle. Not only will this result in more sleepless nights and fatigue, but can also lead to a variety of health problems including heart disease, weight gain, depression, and anxiety.

### Set a bedtime

Keeping a regular sleep schedule - even on weekends - maintains the timing of the body's internal clock and can help you fall asleep and wake up more easily. Have a quality sleep of 7–8 hours daily.

Start slowly, start one by one and try to practice that religiously. Don't try to incorporate all the changes in a day, it will not be sustainable. First set up a waking time for you and try to wake up daily at the same time. Follow this for 7 days and once you are able to do this, then try to incorporate the other changes one by one and follow it.

Do you know that if we practice anything for 21 days, it will become a habit? Once you start following it, it soon becomes a habit.
Following a routine schedule will make you relieve from stress. Self-discipline will reduce stress. If we are disciplined and do our work on time then there will not be any stress in life.

Along with regularizing your timing, I am going to ask you to maintain two journals.

1. Activity Journal
2. Food Journal

### Activity Journal

Write down your to-do list for the day in your activity journal. Prioritize your work and see that you finish up all your work on time. You will be surprised to see how much time will be left over for you.

### Food Journal

Start to maintain a food journal about what you eat daily and mention the timings also. This will help you find your problem area in food.
Start following all the points discussed above and let me meet you in my next blog where we look into each component of a healthy lifestyle and its benefits.
