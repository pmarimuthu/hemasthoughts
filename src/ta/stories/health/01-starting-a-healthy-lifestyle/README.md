## Starting a Healthy Lifestyle <Badge text="health" />

Are you ready to start a healthy lifestyle? and do not know where to start and how to proceed? Then you are at the right place and continue to read my blog.

### First, let me start by explaining what is a healthy lifestyle.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity," which implies that this concept goes beyond the existence or lack of existence illnesses.

Consequently, more than just healthy living, we must talk about a healthy lifestyle that includes food, physical exercise, preventive healthcare, work, the relationship with the environment, and social activity.

### A healthy lifestyle gives you a longer and happier life.

With the increasing prevalence of lifestyle diseases in India, one out of four Indians is at risk of dying from non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular ailments, or cancer before the age of seventy.
Adopting bad habits, such as poor diet, lack of exercise, irregular sleep patterns, and resorting to excessive smoking or alcohol use might put you in with 38 million people, who are limited due to one or more chronic health conditions.
Actually, the fact is we all know the importance of following a healthy lifestyle, but the problem most of us have is we do not know where to 
start.

### Components of a healthy lifestyle

The main components that need to be followed for a healthy lifestyle are,
1. Balanced Diet
2. Adequate Exercise
3. Quality Sleep
4. Emotional Health

Before getting into each component and to know about its importance, we need to regularize our timings for our day to day activities and allocate time for our health. In this blog, we are mainly going to focus on how to regularize our timings for our activities and allocate time for our health.

1. Set up a waking time for you.
2. Don't check your phone upon waking up.
3. Do exercise, pranayama, and meditation
4. Have your dinner at least 2 hours before going to bed.
5. Stop using electronic devices 30 minutes before bed
6. Set a bedtime.

Now let us see each step in detail

### Set up a waking time

Set up a waking time which suits you sometime between 5 to 7. If it is preferably matching with sunrise it is pretty much good. Make sure you are waking up daily at the same time. When we wake up and go to sleep at the same time each day, the quality of our sleep can improve, and help us to feel inspired, invigorated, and alert throughout the day.

### Don't check your phone upon waking up

Don't check your phone upon waking up. It is preferred you switch off your data or Wi-Fi connection when you go to bed. When you wake up and immediately check your phone, you're being bombarded with new messages, emails, to-dos, and other stimuli that often create a feeling of stress and anxiety. So, if you want to avoid starting your day feeling rushed, stressed, and anxious, stop checking your smartphone right after waking up.

###  Do exercise, pranayama, and meditation

Allocate time for your exercise routine, be it walking, gym, or yoga. Practice pranayama daily. Meditate at least 10 minutes daily. After you finish your morning routine then you can watch your phone.

### Have your dinner at least 2 hours before going to bed

Have your dinner at least 2 hours before going to bed allowing the stomach to properly digest and focus on preparing for sleep. The foods you consume can disrupt your sleep patterns and also can cause the body's metabolism to slow.

### Stop using electronic devices 30 minutes before bed

Usage of electronic devices before bed can interfere with your sleep. Blue light disrupts the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates the body's sleep cycle. Not only will this result in more sleepless nights and fatigue, but can also lead to a variety of health problems including heart disease, weight gain, depression, and anxiety.

### Set a bedtime

Keeping a regular sleep schedule - even on weekends - maintains the timing of the body's internal clock and can help you fall asleep and wake up more easily. Have a quality sleep of 7–8 hours daily.

Start slowly, start one by one and try to practice that religiously. Don't try to incorporate all the changes in a day, it will not be sustainable. First set up a waking time for you and try to wake up daily at the same time. Follow this for 7 days and once you are able to do this, then try to incorporate the other changes one by one and follow it.

Do you know that if we practice anything for 21 days, it will become a habit? Once you start following it, it soon becomes a habit.
Following a routine schedule will make you relieve from stress. Self-discipline will reduce stress. If we are disciplined and do our work on time then there will not be any stress in life.

Along with regularizing your timing, I am going to ask you to maintain two journals.

1. Activity Journal
2. Food Journal

### Activity Journal

Write down your to-do list for the day in your activity journal. Prioritize your work and see that you finish up all your work on time. You will be surprised to see how much time will be left over for you.

### Food Journal

Start to maintain a food journal about what you eat daily and mention the timings also. This will help you find your problem area in food.
Start following all the points discussed above and let me meet you in my next blog where we look into each component of a healthy lifestyle and its benefits.
