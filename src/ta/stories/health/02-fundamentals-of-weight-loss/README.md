## Fundamentals of Weight Loss <Badge text="health" />

In this article, I am going to talk about the fundamentals of weight loss. First, what is weight loss, by its name itself we can understand that it is a reduction in body weight? This can be intentional and unintentional. Here in this article, I am going to focus on intentional weight loss. What is intentional weight loss? Intentional weight loss is the loss of total body mass as a result of efforts to improve fitness and health.

### Body Mass Index (BMI)

BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. Based on BMI, we can say whether a person is underweight, Normal weight, Over Weight, or Obese

::: tip
The formula to calculate BMI <br/>
### BMI = Weight in kilograms/height in meters squared
:::

The WHO defines an adult who has a BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight, BMI between 18.5 to 24.9 as a healthy weight, BMI between 25 and 29.9 as overweight, and an adult who has a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese.

If we reduce our weight, our BMI will also reduce.
We can also check whether we are in ideal weight or not by doing a simple calculation. That is our ideal weight will be 
::: tip
Ideal weight= Height in cm - 100

### Calorie
What is a Calorie? A calorie is a unit of energy. In nutrition, calories refer to the energy we get from the food and drink we consume, and the energy we use in physical activity. 

For Example, if we have a small apple, we will get 78 calories of energy. Approximately we burn around 40 calories when we walk for 1 Km. This depends on various factors like the speed of our walk, weight, etc.

### Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

BMR is the amount of energy per unit of time that a person needs to keep the body functioning at rest. Some of those processes are breathing, blood circulation, controlling body temperature, cell growth, brain and nerve function, and contraction of muscles.

We can check our BMR [here](https://bit.ly/3oU8MzD).

### Total Daily Energy Expenditure(TDEE)

TDEE is the estimation of how many calories you burn each day including typical exercise. TDEE is the number of calories you burn with physical activities and the BMR.

The number of calories you burn includes all the working out we do as well as all the little things we do like showering, walking around the office, taking out the trash, cuddling with puppies, yelling at the TV… You know. Normal stuff.

### Understanding weight loss

Once you know your BMR and TDEE, all you need to do is make sure your caloric consumption is less than that number!

So if your TDEE ends up being 2,200 calories per day, you need to eat fewer calories to achieve "weight loss".

::: tip
* If your calorie consumption is equal to your TDEE, you will maintain your current weight.
* If your calorie consumption is less than your TDEE then you will lose weight.
* How fast you lose it depends on how much your deficit is every day.
* Generally speaking, there are about **7,000 calories in a kilogram**.
:::

Most dieticians recommend eating a deficit of anywhere between 500–1,000 calories a day. So In a week, there will be a deficit of 3500–7000 KiloCal which leads to a weight loss of 500–1000g in a week.
The goal is not to lose weight the fastest - it's to be consistent.

### Where Does Body Fat Go When You Lose Weight?

When you restrict the calories you eat, you take in fewer calories than your body needs. Because of this deficit, your body turns to fat reserves for energy.
The fat deposits in the body leave the body,
* As water, through our skin (when you sweat) and your kidneys (when you urinate).
* Like carbon dioxide, through your lungs (when you breathe out).

That's why it is more important to keep our body well hydrated and also to breathe properly when we are exercising to flush out the fats and toxins from the body.

### What happens to body fat when we exercise?

Our muscles first burn through stored glycogen for energy. "After about 30 to 60 minutes of aerobic exercise, our body starts burning mainly fat," says Dr. Burguera. (If you're exercising moderately, this takes about an hour.)

Experts recommend at least 30 minutes of cardio two to three times a week.

They also recommend weightlifting and resistance training. Increasing muscle mass may help you burn more calories and raise your basic metabolic rate.

Exercise also increases your respiratory rate, so **more CO2 leaves your body when you work out**.

### About exercise and weight loss

"Exercise is key to weight loss and to maintaining that weight loss," says Dr. Burguera.
But it may take time to move the number on your scale, so be patient.

Everyone's response to exercise varies: Some people lose weight, others maintain it, and a few may even gain a few pounds and some people lose only inches.

"Generally, however, people who successfully lose weight and keep it off tend to be physically active - up to an hour per day," he says. "Engaging in some form of exercise three times per week is highly recommended."

### Consistency

Consistency plays a key role in weight loss. A new study suggests that slowly but steadily shedding pounds each week can be more beneficial for long-term weight loss than seeing your weight drastically drop, only to rise again.

Developing a stable schedule of healthy eating and exercise can help with keeping our weight management consistent.

Healthy eating is not like a vaccine: one shot and you're covered for life. Instead, it requires a daily, lifelong commitment. There is growing evidence that the more consistent you are in your wholesome eating habits, the greater your chances of maintaining healthy body weight.

Whenever you are losing the focus on weight loss, just think of why you have started this journey.
