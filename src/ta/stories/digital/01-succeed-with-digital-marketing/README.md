## How to Succeed with Digital Marketing? <Badge text="digital" type="error" />

This article is about my understanding of *Marketing* and **Digital Marketing** as part of the internship in digital marketing. I am doing this internship in [Digital Deepak](https://digitaldeepak.com/) under the guidance of [Mr. Deepak Kanakaraju](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepakkanakaraju/).
[How to Succeed with Digital Marketing?](https://medium.com/@hema.thiruchelvam07/how-to-succeed-with-digital-marketing-75f0b2fddc78/)

### First let me explain, What is Marketing?

Marketing is how we promote sales or to bring awareness of a product or service to customers through advertising or market research. 
For Example, if a company **X** is bringing in a new product called **Y**, company X will use television advertisements, billboards on the side of the road or the magazine advertisement to make the public aware of the launch of the product Y.

The Basic law of Marketing is to **understand the customer and customer’s needs** that leads to creating a product that fits the customer needs. 
Marketing is a *lifelong process*. *It doesn’t end with sales*. 
You have to constantly interact with your existing customers and build a *relationship of trust* with them. Basically marketing is about sending the right message, to the right person and at the right time.

### What is Digital Marketing?

Digital marketing is marketing using an electronic device or the internet. <br />
We use digital channels such as search engines, social media, email, and other websites to perform marketing with customers. <br />
The number of people who use the internet is increasing day by day. As we have seen earlier, Marketing has always been about connecting with your audience in the right place and at the right time. Today, that means you need to meet them where they are already spending time: on the internet.

### Why to learn Digital Marketing
Digital Marketing has a lot of opportunities, not only in terms of job but also one can earn as a freelance digital marketer. The job opportunities in digital marketing is expected to reach **1,50,000** by the end of 2020.

Learning Digital Marketing will help you to drive more **traffic** for your business through YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn etc. These applications will help you to reach the customers easily and help in advertising about your product. *As the marketing cannot be outsourced completely to a marketing agency, the founder should be a marketer*. So that the founder himself strategizes his thoughts and can be successful in his/her business.

### Importance of Communication in Marketing

Good marketing is all about good *communication*. Here my mentor gave a completely different perspective on communication that is very true, **Good communication does not be in sophisticated English, don't confuse communication skill with language skills**. The only thing we need to focus on is **Am I able to transfer my thoughts to you effectively**. A good communicator can be a good marketer.

### How to improve your communication
* 1. Write like you talk
* 2. Write more (a minimum 500–1000 words per day.)
* 3. Read more books, magazines, blogs
* 4. Watch English sitcoms and shows
* 5. Think in English

### CATT Marketing Funnel and Framework
**Wealth = n^CATT**
Where **^** denotes power.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*7CaX8egsRHh_x7_mAGjoRQ.png)

**Wealth = n^CATT** <br/>
**n** stands for Niche. It is very important to select a Niche wisely as success and wealth depends on the niche you choose. <br/>
**C** stands for Content. You need to create useful content, blogs, emails, videos, podcasts, webinars, posts, and much more to generate leads. **A** stands for Attention. It drives traffic to your content using SEO, social media, paid ads and referrals. <br/>
**T** stands for Trust. Build trust with your audience. Deep Marketing is connecting with your customers on a deeper level. <br/>
**T** stands for Transaction. This converts your leads into customers and to sales. <br/>

### Niche Selection

You need to find your niche first, the best way to find your niche is to know three things.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*TKIiqlKVJhG8MGqux-X5CA.png)

* Do you have a talent?
* Are you passionate about that talent?
* Is there a market for the talent that you have?

So if you have a talent, you are passionate about the skills and there is a market for the talent, then you can select that *talent as your niche* and you can work on it to develop further. <br />
For Example, If you have a talent and are passionate about painting but if there is no market for it, then nobody will buy the product. Likewise if you have a talent for weaving and there is a market also for that but if you are not passionate about it, you will not be interested to do that.

### Integrated Digital Marketing

Integrated Digital marketing is integration of multiple marketing strategies. <br />

### Types of Digital marketing strategies are
* web development and design
* search engine optimization (SEO) and search engine marketing (SEM)
* content marketing
* social media marketing
* local listings management
* paid advertising (or pay-per-click advertising) campaigns

Content in the center, drive attention through paid advertising, build trust through email marketing, SEO and Social media and do transactions through sales & conversion.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*XIkp4s-5YuNfGx3lMxZUhQ.png)

The idea behind integrated digital marketing is that, while each individual strategy doesn’t have a huge impact on its own, when used in combinations, you can create a more influential online presence.

### Personal Brand

To build your Personal Brand it’s important to *Market yourself*.
You become the Brand Ambassador for the Brand you run.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*eqnH2bhNbsuGLSp9.jpeg)

Building a personal brand is as good as building your personal reputation. <br />
You start small by what so ever means and eventually grow it till everyone knows about the brand name. You earn reputation at each level.
A personal brand cannot be invested in and cannot be sold.
There are many examples for personal brands like Elon Musk, Digital Deepak.

### How to evolve a personal brand
**Learn >> Work >> Blog >> Consult >> Startup >>>>**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*RkAqEiQirONce4e-vgiCrw.png)

* 1. Learn
Learn a new skill through concepts, facts and procedures. Understanding the concepts, remembering the facts and practicing the procedure will help your personal brand to build.
* 2. Work
Work on your new found skill. Practice and implement in the real world will give you better understanding.
* 3. Blog
Write about what you have learned and experienced through your work. You will understand it better when you will write. It will also help in building your brand.
* 4. Consult
As you have a personal brand now through your blog, you have work experience and have learned the fundamentals, you can start consulting other businesses.
* 5. Mentor

Finally, as our mentor says **"Choose a category and become a leader in that category with your personal brand. People will always remember only the No 1. Be the No 1 in whatever category you choose or be No 1 in the sub category.”**

With the learnings of marketing, understanding and implementing the concepts of Digital marketing and with success mindset you can reach heights in Digital marketing.

*Wish you all the very best*;
