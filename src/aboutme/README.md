# About Hema :writing_hand:

I, [Hema Thiruchelvam](https://medium.com/@hema.thiruchelvam07), worked in [Infosys](https://www.infosys.com/) for 5 years after finishing my Engineering in Computer Science from [Sona College of Technology](https://www.sonatech.ac.in/) . After that I have taken a career break for taking care of my kids. When i was thinking of to restart my career, I came across the internship on [Digital Marketing](https://www.digitalmarketingmastery.in/) by [Digital Deepak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepakkanakaraju/). As it sounds interesting with me, I thought of entering into Digital Marketing world! after that there is no second thought.

I believe, my strengths are communicating with people, time management, commitment and honest.
